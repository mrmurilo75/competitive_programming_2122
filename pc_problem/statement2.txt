You are trying to figure out a way to travel back in time, possibly to see the start of the universe. The problem is that time traveling is a series of jumps through wormholes, so you may need to do many jumps, each with a resulting difference in time from where you started. See if through these jumps it is possible to go as far back in time as necessary.

## Input

The first line of input is the number of test cases (T <= 100). For each test case, the following line contain the number of possible jumps N (0 < N < 1000) and the next N lines contain integers 1 <= A, B <= 1000 representing a path from A to B and a difference of time -500 <= W <= 500, in the format A W B.

## Output

For each test case, print one line with "YES" or "NO" if it is or not possible to travel back in time infinitly starting from the node 1.
