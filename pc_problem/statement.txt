The captain of the spaceship Interstellar Enterprise has tasked you with upgrading the routing system. You need to develop an algorithm to choose the fastest path, possibly using worm-holes. The problem is that, even though worm-holes take you far away and a little bit back in time, they make the crew sick. So, depending on the importance of reaching the destination fastest, the captain will tell you how many worm-holes can be in the route.

## Input

The first line of input is the number of test cases (T <= 100). After that, for each test case, you will receive a number N, the amount of paths. The following N lines contain integers 1 <= A, B <= 1000 representing a path from A to B and a cost of time -500 <= W <= 500, in the format A W B. The last line of each test case contains the maximum number of worm-holes that can be in the path 0 <= M <= 500. (Obs.: It is garanteed that the input graph does not contain any negative cycles)

## Output

For each test case, print one line with the minimal cost of time to travel from 1 to the biggest value B. If there is no path in the worm-hole limit, print “GET WELL” followed by the cost with least worm-holes.
